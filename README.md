# RAWork Plan

**Month 1: Project Setup and Data Collection**
  Week 1-2: Project Definition and Planning
  •	Define the project's objectives and scope.
  •	Identify the target audience and magazine themes.
  •	Set specific goals for prompt generation accuracy and diversity.
  •	Create a project timeline and allocate resources.
  Week 3-4: Data Collection and Preparation
  •	Gather a diverse dataset of magazine sections and article topics.
  •	Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring consistency and quality.
  •	Organize the data into appropriate structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

**Month 2: Model Development and Testing**
  Week 1-2: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Setup
  •	Explore and choose an NLP framework or library (e.g., spaCy, GPT-3, GPT-4).
  •	Set up the chosen NLP environment and obtain necessary credentials.
  
  Week 3-4: Prompt Generation Algorithm
  •	Develop an initial algorithm for generating prompts.
  •	Implement grammar and style checks to ensure coherent prompts.
  •	Create a basic user interface for generating prompts.

**Month 3: Enhancement and Deployment**
  Week 1-2: Algorithm Refinement
  •	Fine-tune the prompt generation algorithm based on user feedback.
  •	Optimize for diversity, relevance, and user customization.
  •	Test the algorithm rigorously with sample users.

  Week 3-4: Deployment and User Testing	•	Deploy the prompt generation system to a web or mobile platform.
  •	Conduct user testing and gather feedback on generated prompts.
  •	Address any issues or improvements identified during testing.
  •	Finalize documentation and user guides.

##  How to troubleshoot OR how will you know the model is doing a good job?

The effectiveness of the magazine prompt generation model can be assessed using a number of crucial indicators and techniques.
  •	Implement grammar and spelling checks to identify problems. 
  •	Keep track of how many prompts include problems. 
  •	Measure the prompts' suitability for the chosen magazine section or topic.
  •	Check to see if the generated prompts are appropriate for the users' content requirements. 
  •	Logs of errors to keep track of system problems, crashes, or strange behavior, implement error logging. Review error logs frequently 
    to find and fix technical problems.
  •	Continuous testing is important for finding and fixing bugs. Prompt generation regressions can be found with the aid of automated 
    testing scripts.
  •	Scaling Problems Keep track on resource usage and system performance.
